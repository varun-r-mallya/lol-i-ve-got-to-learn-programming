# lol-i-ve-got-to-learn-programming
Just starting out, few shitty projects here and there, nothing much
I just started learning programming. I am gonna write IIT-JEE next year so I am quite busy preparing for it. Figured I could do with a github profile, so i created it.
The volume of projects that are going to come in here will be very low for the next one or two years and then I'll probably be doing engineering....preferably from IIT-roorkee or IIT-kanpur..or kharagpur or madras or Bombay. Electronics and communication is what i wanna take, so programming will be really important for me. But I LOVE physics tho. Quantum mechanics and General relativity are nice. I wanna actually work in Fusion technology after i graduate, but since this is India, Physics has about 0 scope and youll not be paid a penny if you are a physicist. I've wanted to be a scientist since i was 4 years old. Never changed. Never will. Anyway, I am searching for people who have an Engineering Physics Degree from any IIT in India, cause i wanna know if there are any jobs...at all, available for those graduates. My plan is to do ECE from one of those premier institutes, get a fucking well payin job, make as much money as i can and then settle abroad after a masters(possibly Ph.D..in quantum physics) in quantum mech or high energy physics or plasma physics. Anyway, bye.
Before leaving, if anyone knows ANYTHING at all about FPGA programming, pls email me about where to learn it from.
